Q:What does the XML language represents? What does it used for? 

A:XML is a markup language for documents containing structured information.

Structured information contains both content (words, pictures, etc.) 
and some indication of what role that content plays (for example, 
content in a section heading has a different meaning from content in 
a footnote, which means something different than content in a figure 
caption or content in a database table, etc.). Almost all documents 
have some structure.

A markup language is a mechanism to identify structures in a 
document. The XML specification defines a standard way to add 
markup to documents.
